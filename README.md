# VLMs and Their Ability to Understand Meme's


The idea for this project occured when the Janus Pro model by DeepSeek AI dropped. I was reading through the paper and in my hyped frame of mind I thought I read the model excels in MEME Perception...in fact, what the paper actually said was the model excels in [MME Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13394). 

However, it turns out that MME-perception measures against a total of 10 subtasks for the evaluation of the perception ability, from the perspectives of coarse-grained recognition, fine-grained recognition, and OCR...which actually isn't all that different than meme perception.

Anyways, the end result is this small project which I hope you find entertaining.
